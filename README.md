# Driving Habits & Fuel Efficiency

This project analyzes the **mtcars dataset** to study the effect of driving habits (engine displacement, vehicle weight, transmission type, and acceleration) on fuel efficiency (MPG).

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Regression Modeling  
- Causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)  
- Visualization of key relationships  

## Files
- `Research_Final.qmd` → RStudio Quarto file with code & analysis  
- `Bandarupalli_Research_Final.pdf` → Final report  

## Tools Used
- **R, RStudio, Quarto**
- **ggplot2** for visualization
- **Regression models** for MPG analysis
